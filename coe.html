            <p>
                The Friends of Africa Students Union (FASU) stands as a call to action, inviting students to lead the charge in Africa's socio-economic development. Our strength lies in the ethical standards we uphold, both individually and collectively. This Code of Ethics outlines the core values expected of every member, partner, and representative of FASU.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>1. Honesty and Integrity:</b>
                Every member shall act truthfully, transparently, and with a commitment to doing what is right, even when no one is watching. We reject deceit, fraud, and misrepresentation in all forms.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>2. Loyalty and Fidelity to Trust:</b>
                Members must remain loyal to the mission of FASU and honor the trust placed in them by fellow members, communities, and institutions. Trustworthiness is non-negotiable.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3. Fairness and Respect:</b>
                All individuals must be treated with dignity, regardless of background, nationality, or beliefs. We do not tolerate discrimination, exploitation, or favoritism in any form.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>4. Confidentiality:</b>
                Members shall safeguard any confidential information shared in trust and shall not disclose sensitive material without explicit permission or necessity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>5. Personal Honor and Responsibility:</b>
                Every member is expected to uphold high standards of personal conduct and accountability. Actions should reflect the values of FASU both within and outside the organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>6. Ethical Leadership:</b>
                Members in leadership roles must serve with humility, vision, and discipline. Influence should be used to uplift, not control.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>7. Commitment to Africa’s Development:</b>
                All members must remain focused on the larger mission — contributing meaningfully to Africa’s moral, intellectual, political, and economic growth through active student leadership and collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>8. Violations and Enforcement:</b>
                Any breach of this Code will be taken seriously. Depending on the nature and severity, violations may result in disciplinary action, suspension, or removal from the organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>9. Revisions to This Code:</b>
                FASU reserves the right to amend this Code of Ethics to reflect evolving needs, values, or conditions. Updates will be published on our official website.
            </p>
